	Why are private prisons allowed to prosper at the expense of Americans and who is responsible for the uptick in this terrible trend? </p>
	<p>
	It was President Clinton who accelerated the role that private prisons play in our society. He started a trend that has decimated many communities, particularly African Americans. </p>

	<p>
	In 1999 and under Presidnt Clinton's leadership, nearly 70,000 Americans were locked up in private prisons. And though there are apparently no statistics on race, we now know that disproportionate numbers of African American men are in American prisons. One year later, an additional 23,000 people were locked up. And the private prison industry was off and running and continues to do well today.</p>

	<p>In 2005, President H.W. Bush took his seat in the White House and the numbers started to drop. They have never again risen as they did during the Clinton years.</p>
